# Existence-Essence Analysis

Challenge appeals to fixed identity, human nature, or predetermined essence by revealing identity as created through choices, not discovered as a given. Use Sartre's central claim—"existence precedes essence"—to liberate from false determinism.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## When to Use

- User says "That's just who I am"
- User invokes "human nature" to justify behavior
- User claims they "can't change" because of their nature
- User hides behind identity ("As an introvert, I...")
- Analysis of why someone feels fixed or determined
- Someone treats their past self as their permanent self
- Appeals to personality types, astrology, or other essentializing frameworks

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **claimed_essence** | Yes | The fixed identity or nature being invoked |
| **behavior_justified** | Yes | What the essence claim excuses or explains |
| **context** | No | Situation where this is occurring |

## Sartre's Framework

### The Paper-Knife Argument
A paper-knife exists because someone first conceived it—its essence (purpose, design) precedes its existence. It was designed before it was made.

But humans? We are not designed. There is no craftsman who conceived "human nature" before creating us. We exist first—we appear on the scene—and only afterwards define ourselves.

**"Man is nothing other than what he makes of himself."**

### Existence Precedes Essence
For humans:
1. We exist (we are born, we appear)
2. We encounter ourselves in the world
3. We define ourselves through choices
4. We become what we make of ourselves

There is no pre-given human nature that determines what we must be. We are "condemned to be free" to create ourselves.

### The Flight to Essence
When we claim a fixed nature, we flee from freedom:
- "I'm just not a morning person" (treats habit as nature)
- "I have an addictive personality" (treats pattern as essence)
- "I'm an introvert, so I can't..." (treats type as determination)
- "That's how I was raised" (treats past as prison)

These claims treat the self as a thing with fixed properties rather than a consciousness that continuously creates itself.

### The Papier-Mache Self
We construct a stable "self" to avoid the anxiety of perpetual self-creation. But this constructed self is papier-mache—a fiction we maintain rather than a reality we discover.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Essence Claim
What fixed nature or identity is being invoked?
- Personality traits ("I'm just a pessimist")
- Types and categories ("As an INTJ...")
- Nature vs. nurture ("It's in my genes")
- Historical identity ("I've always been...")
- Role identities ("As a mother, I naturally...")

### Step 2: Expose the Creation
How was this "essence" actually created?
- Through repeated choices that became habits
- Through accepting others' definitions
- Through avoiding the anxiety of change
- Through identifying with a comfortable narrative

### Step 3: Reveal the Ongoing Choice
Show how the "nature" is actually maintained:
- "You are not a pessimist; you choose pessimistic interpretations"
- "You are not an introvert; you choose solitary patterns"
- "You don't 'have' anger issues; you repeatedly choose angry responses"

### Step 4: Open the Alternative
What would it mean to recognize freedom here?
- Not that they must change, but that they could
- The "nature" is a choice, not a fate
- They are creating themselves, not discovering themselves

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- Claimed essence: "I'm just not a creative person"
- Behavior justified: "That's why I can't come up with new ideas at work"
- Context: "Being asked to contribute to brainstorming sessions"

**Output:**

## Existence-Essence Analysis

### The Essence Claim
"I'm not a creative person" treats creativity as a fixed property that some people have and others lack—an essence that determines capacity.

### The Creation Exposed
You were not born "non-creative." This identity was constructed through:
- Moments when creative attempts were criticized or ignored
- Comparisons to others labeled "creative"
- Adopting a narrative that creativity is for "creative types"
- Avoiding creative risks to avoid creative failures
- Repeatedly telling yourself and others "I'm not creative"

Each time you said "I'm not creative," you created yourself as not-creative. The identity was not discovered; it was made.

### The Ongoing Choice Revealed
Right now, you are not failing to be creative because of your nature. You are:
- Choosing to interpret your ideas as "not creative enough"
- Choosing to compare yourself to an idealized "creative person"
- Choosing to sit back rather than risk contribution
- Choosing to maintain a narrative that protects you from failure

"I'm not creative" is not a fact you discovered but a story you tell—and you tell it every time you decline to create.

### Freedom Recovered
You are not condemned to be "non-creative." You are condemned to be free.

You could, right now, offer an idea. It might be bad. It might be brilliant. But you would be creating—and in creating, you would become a person who creates.

"Creative person" is not a category you belong to or don't. It's a description of someone who chooses to create. Creativity is not an essence but an action.

### Sartre's Challenge
"You say you are not creative. But you are not a paper-knife, designed for a purpose before you existed. You have no 'nature' that determines whether you can create.

You have only your choices. Every moment you sit in silence because 'you're not creative,' you choose to make yourself non-creative. And every moment you speak, you could choose otherwise.

Man is nothing other than what he makes of himself. What will you make?"

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Genuine neurological difference | Acknowledge facticity while preserving freedom of response |
| User defensive about identity | Stay phenomenological, not accusatory |
| Identity tied to trauma | Handle gently; the point is freedom, not blame |
| Cultural/structural constraints | Acknowledge real limits while revealing transcendence |
